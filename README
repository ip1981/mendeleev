Mendeleev — find chemical elements in words.

For example, the word "Moscow" can be split in the following ways:
    Mo S C O W,
    Mo S Co W,
    Mo Sc O W,
where:
    Mo — Molybdenum,
    S  — Sulfur,
    Sc — Scandium,
    C  — Carbon,
    Co — Cobalt,
    W  — Wolfram (Tungsten).

When a character cannot be found among the chemical elements, it's replaced
with a question mark:
    language -> La N ? U Ag ?

There are implementations in several programming languages.  Each program
accepts words as arguments and prints all the possible combinations,
for example:

    $ ./mendeleev-c preprocessor
    preprocessor:
     P Re P ? O C Es S O ?
     P Re P ? O Ce S S O ?
     P Re Pr O C Es S O ?
     P Re Pr O Ce S S O ?
     Pr ? P ? O C Es S O ?
     Pr ? P ? O Ce S S O ?
     Pr ? Pr O C Es S O ?
     Pr ? Pr O Ce S S O ?
